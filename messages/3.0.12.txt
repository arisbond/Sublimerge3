What's new?
===========


Bug Fixes:
  - #3: Slow startup
        Changes in VCS cache mechanism to boost startup process. Additionally added the following
        settings:
          - vcs_cache_enabled: true
          - vcs_cache_validate_on_startup: true

        NOTE: Before changing these settings please check if the problem with slow startup persists.

  - #7: Copying new file in directory diff doesn't update properly
        Fixed an issue with updating directories listing after copying files. Please report if this still
        happens.

  - #7: Copying new file in directory diff doesn't update properly
        Probably fixed an issue with updating directories listing after copying files. Please report if
        this still persists.


Improvements:
  - #2: Added setting `save_and_stay` to disable Save & Stay feature. If you disable it, Sublimerge window
        will be closed upon saving a file (just like Sublimerge 2 did).

  - #6: Added new keyboard shortcuts for Directories Diff for quick navigation through changes only.
        For list of shortcuts take a look below into "Simplified usage instructions"

  - Display change regions on minimap in Directories Diff

    [ctrl]+[down]                         - select next change
    [ctrl]+[up]                           - select previous change

    [ctrl]+[shift]+[left]                 - copy all changes to left from right
    [ctrl]+[shift]+[right]                - copy all changes to right from left

    OS X:

    [alt]+[down]                          - select next change
    [alt]+[up]                            - select previous change

    [f4]                                  - show changes navigator
    [f5]                                  - recompare buffers
