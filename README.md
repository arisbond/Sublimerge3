# Text Diff
Sublimerge 3 makes it extremely easy to work with compared files. All the differences are marked in the gutter so the text area remains clear and waits for your input. All your modifications are immediately reflected as you type. Cut, copy & paste the text. Thanks to unlimited undo/redo stack you don't have to worry about mistakes. It all just works.

# Three-way Text Diff
Configure Sublimerge as your diff & merge tool and resolve conflicts easily right in your editor. Advanced merging capabilities will be your secret weapon. Resolve conflicts one-by-one by using advanced merge commands. If it's still too less, remember that Live Diff also works in three-way mode!

# Directories Diff
Sublimerge compares directories side-by-side, digging down in the hierarchy. When a directory contains any difference at any level, it gets marked as different. When you find differences, you can simply clone files or directories from one side to the other. You can also run Text Diff for selected text files right in the same window!

# Version Control Systems
Sublimerge comes with predefined commands that will improve your workflow with versioned files. For instance, you can quickly compare your working copy to any revision. You can even view, verify and revert uncommited changes. That's magically simple. If this is still too less, you can define your own commands using Macros feature.

# Live Diff
Edit the files directly in the diff view. All changes will be automatically updated as you type. Works in both 2-way and 3-way diff!

# Undo & Redo
Unlimited undo and redo stack will let you fix the mistakes.

# Full Sublime Text integration
Sublimerge fully integrates into your editor, no matter what your operating system is. Forget about external tools just to check differences between files, their revisions or even their fragments. You get it all built-in. Out of the box.

# Simplicity & Productivity
Everything you need to do is to learn a few keyboard or mouse shortcuts to make your work with diffs more productive. If you are lazy, every command is available from context menus and Command Palette. Just that simple.

# Snapshots
Create snapshots of your code to store temporarily important changes. Later merge your changes from snapshots or even fully revert to given point in time. Snapshots can be created manually and/or each time you open or save file.

# Showing differences
Colorful gutter lines will show you clearly which fragments are different or missing. Intraline changes will be also highlighted to help you focus your eyes on small differences.

# Macros
Define macros where you can decide what and how to compare. Sublimerge comes with a few predefined Macros for Git, SVN and Mercurial users which allows you to compare and merge files across branches and view uncommited changes. You can also define your own macros to do custom things.
